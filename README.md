ProjectEuler
============
This project contains Regynald Augustin's solution code for 50+(coming soon) Project Euler problems.

Each solution is written in Java. The code here should be used for reference, and not to obtain solutions. 

I'm still just a poor boy with a computer and a dream, trying to learn git.
